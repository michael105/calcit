#calcit (calc)


Part of an expression parser and calculator.

This is a standalone version.

Currently I'm about to rewrite some things,
the ongoing work is in calc2.c

Originally I did want to implement the option of having
arithmetic expressions in config files, and to parse and compile them.
(For things like: if the mouse movement is faster than x/second, 
speed up with 2*x..)

Didn't write the config parser yet.

The recursive calculation has been a special pain in the ass.

It's tiny - 8k at OSX, compiled statically with minilib (optional)


6.3k linked statically with minilib, linux x64.


Working: (calc)
+ - * / 
% ^ $  	  ( Modulo, Power,  unsigned power-  ipowerui)
& | ! ~ X (Binary ops: ~ is bitwise not,  X is XOR)
L R 		  Shift left / right
< >       evals left side / right side, gives smaller / bigger value
=				  1, if equal


All operations are in integer mode, so no floating point yet.
Originally I did want to have some sort of scripting available for config files.
