#calcit (calc)

.. a terminal calculator, mainly for developers, 
able to parse nested expressions, branches,
show results in octal, hexadecimal, binary. 
(Show hexadecimal and binary the way it is internally stored,
important for negative numbers)

Originally I did want to implement the option of having
arithmetic expressions in config files, and to parse and compile them.
(For things like: if the mouse movement is faster than x/second, 
speed up with 2*x..)

Didn't write the config parser yet.
;) So, here is a calculator instead. 

The recursive calculation has been a special pain in the ass.

It's tiny - 8k at OSX, compiled statically with minilib (optional)

Might be quite performant, when e.g. using this to 1. enter a function,
and 2. calculate the results for different inputs.


6.3k linked statically with minilib, linux x64.


Working: 
+ - * / 
% ^ $  	  ( Modulo, Power,  unsigned power-  ipowerui)
& | ! ~ X (Binary ops: ~ is bitwise not,  X is XOR)
L R 		  Shift left / right
< >       evals left side / right side, gives smaller / bigger value
=				  1, if equal


All operations are in integer mode, so no floating point yet.
Originally I did want to have some sort of scripting available for config files.
Today I needed the XOR; so I did the port to OSX x64.
Branches aren't thoroughly tested.

Happy hacking
