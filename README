#calcit (calc)
.. a terminal calculator, able to parse nested expressions, branches

The recursive calculation has been a special pain in the ass.
Cant believe it's working.
And it's tiny - 8k at OSX, compiled statically with minilib (optional)


Redistribute as you wish, 
but you are required to drop me an email.
Thanks in advance.

I don't guarantee any function, by the way.
Although I've thoroughly tested.


Working: 
+ - * / 
% ^ $  	( Modulo, Power,  unsigned power-  ipowerui)
& | ! ~ X (Binary ops: ~ is bitwise not,  X is XOR)
L R 		Shift left / right
< >     evals left side / right side, gives smaller / bigger value
=				1, if equal


All operations are in integer mode, so no floating point yet.
Originally I did want to have some sort of scripting available for config files.
Today I needed the XOR; so I did the port to OSX x64.
Branches aren't thoroughly tested.

Happy hacking
